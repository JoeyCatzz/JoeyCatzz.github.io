        <h2 id="revenue">Revenue</h2>
        <p>
            The first line on the income statement is always total, or gross, revenue.<br>
            The fact that a company has a lot of revenue doesn't mean that it is earning a profit.<br>
            Total revenue minus expenses eaquals net earnings.
        </p>

    <h2 id="gross_profit">Gross Profit</h2>
        <p>
            Gross profit is how much money the company made off of total revenue after subtracting the costs of
            the raw goods and the labor used to make the goods.<br>
            It doesn't include such categories as sales and administrative costs, depreciation, 
            and the intersest cost of running the business.<br>
            <br>Gross profit/Total Revenues * 100 = Gross Profit Margin<br>
            Companies with a Gross Profit margin of 40% or better tend to be companies with some sort 
            of durable competitive advantage.<br>
            
        </p>

    <h2 id="net_earnings">Net Earnings</h2>
        <p>
            net earnings/net income/bottom line<br>
            Where we find out how much money the company has made after it paid income taxes.<br>
            Are the net earnings showing an historical upward trend? A single years entry for net earnings is useless.<br>
            The ride does not have to be smooth but there must be an upward historical trend.

                    <p>
                        Cash flow statements are like income statements in that they always cover a set period of time.<br>
                        Companies use the Accrual Method of accounting, this means that sales are booked when the goods go out the door. 
                        Even if the buyer takes years to pay them.<br> 
                        Because almost all business extend some kind of credit to their buyers. The Accrual Method allows them to book 
                        the sales on credit as income under accounts receivable on the income statement.<br>
                        To track the of  the cash that flows in and out of the business you have the Cash Flow Statement.<br>
                        The Cash Flow Statement will tell us if the company has a positive or nagative cash flow.<br>
                        The Cash Flow Statement breaks down into three sections: operating activities, investing activities and 
                        financing activities.

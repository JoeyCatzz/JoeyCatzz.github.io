                    <p>
                        This is where all the goodies are kept: the cash, the plant and equipment, the patents, ...<br>
                        The balance sheet are divided in two groups: Current Assets, and All Other Assets. Current Assets can be or will be 
                        converted into cash in a very short period of time (usually within a year). As a rule, they are listed on the balance 
                        sheet in order of their liquidity.<br>
                        Current Assets are also known as quick, liquid, or floating assets.<br>
                        <h4>Current Assets Cycle</h4>
                        Current assets are also referred to as the "working assets" of the business because they are in the cycle of cash going 
                        buy inventory; Inventory is then sold to vendors and becomes Accounts Receivable. Accounts Receivable, when collected 
                        from the vendors, they turn back into Cash. This cycle repeats itself over and over again, and it is how a business 
                        makes money.

                        Money owed to the company.<br>
                        When a company sells its products to a purchaser, it does so on the basis of either cash up front or payment due 
                        thirty days after the purchaser receives the goods. In some businesses the cash isn't due for even longer periods. 
                        Sales in this state are called receivables.

                        Businesses sometimes pay for goods and services that they will receive in the near future. They are payed for 
                        so they are assets of the business.

                        These are non-cash assets that are due within the year but are not yet in the company's hands.<br>
                        For instance: deferred income tax recoveries.

            <h2 id="retained_earnings">Retained Earnings</h2>
                <p>
                    A company's net earnings can be paid out as dividends or used to buy back the company's shares, 
                    or it can be retained to keep the business growing.<br>
                    When they are retained in the business, they are added to an account on the balance sheet, under shareholders' equity 
                    called retained earnings.<br>
                    Retained earnings is an accumulated number, which means that each year's new retained earnings are added to the total 
                    of accumulated earnings from all prior years.<br>
                    If a company is not making additions to its retained earnings, it is not growing it's net earnings.
                </p>

            <h2 id="total_shareholders_equity">Total Shareholders Equity</h2>
                <p>
                    Shareholders' equity is equal to the company's total assets minus its total liabilities.<br>
                    That happens to equal the total sums of preferred and common stock, plus paid in capital, 
                    plus retained earnings, less treasury stock.<br>
                    Shareholders' equity has three sources. One is the capital that was originally raised selling preferred 
                    and common stock to the public.<br>
                    The second is any later sales of preferred and common stock to the public after the company is up and running.<br>
                    The third, and most important to us, is the accumulation of retained earnings.

                    Per-share earnings are the net earnings of the company on a per-share basis for the time period in question.<br>
                    Net Income/number of shares outstanding<br>
                    As an example: If a company had net earnings of $10 million for the year, and it has one million shares outstanding, 
                    it would have per-share earnings for the year of $10 a share.

            <h2 id="roe">ROE Return on Shareholders' Equity</h2>
                <p>
                    Net Earnings divided by Shareholders' Equity equals Return on Shareholders' Equity.<br>
                    High returns on equity mean that the company is making good use of the earnings that it is retaining.

                    <p>
                        This is where all the goodies are kept: the cash, the plant and equipment, the patents, ...<br>
                        The balance sheet are divided in two groups: Current Assets, and All Other Assets. Current Assets can be or will be 
                        converted into cash in a very short period of time (usually within a year). As a rule, they are listed on the balance 
                        sheet in order of their liquidity.<br>
                        Current Assets are also known as quick, liquid, or floating assets.<br>
                        <h4>Current Assets Cycle</h4>
                        Current assets are also referred to as the "working assets" of the business because they are in the cycle of cash going 
                        buy inventory; Inventory is then sold to vendors and becomes Accounts Receivable. Accounts Receivable, when collected 
                        from the vendors, they turn back into Cash. This cycle repeats itself over and over again, and it is how a business 
                        makes money.

                        When a company sells its products to a purchaser, it does so on the basis of either cash up front or payment due 
                        thirty days after the purchaser receives the goods. In some businesses the cash isn't due for even longer periods. 
                        Sales in this state are called receivables.

                        Businesses sometimes pay for goods and services that they will receive in the near future. They are payed for 
                        so they are assets of the business.

                        For instance: deferred income tax recoveries.

                        It is believed that if the outcome is below 1 this is a bad thing. How ever strong companies have such strong 
                        earning powers that they can easily cover there current liabilities. Also, they have no problem tapping 
                        into the cheap, short term commercial paper market if they need any additional short term cash.

                        Companies are not allowed to carry internally developed intangible assets on their balance sheet. However, intangible

                        If an asset has an finite life 'as a pattent does' it is amortized over the course of its useful life charge made 
                        to the income statement and the balance sheet.<br>
                        Coca-Cola's brand name is worth in excess of $100 billion, yet because it is an internally developed brand name, 
                        it's real value as an intangible asset is not reflected on the balance sheet.

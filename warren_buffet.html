                <h2>Stock picking strategy</h2>
                    <h3>The business must possess a moat</h3>
                    <p>
                        For Warren to find a business appealing, it must be protected by a moat either in terms of its 
                        intangible assets such as a strong brand, network efficiency, cost advantages, high replacement costs 
                        or high barriers of entry. 
                    </p>

                    <h3>The business must be predictable</h3>
                    <p>
                        As companies that possess a moat are well-protected, these businesses are more stable than those that do 
                        not have a competitive advantage and thus constantly fight against other ‘unprotected’ businesses.<br> 
                        Warren loves simple, stable and predictable companies, evident in a long history of growing revenues, earnings, 
                        and high returns on capital.
                    </p>

                    <h3>The business must have pricing power</h3>
                    <p>
                        It’s alfa-omega for a business’ long-term success that it can increase its prices at a rate that at least 
                        matches inflation. It often requires strong brand loyalty, an indispensable product, a well-protected industry 
                        or the like. If a company offers a product/service that consumers continue to consume despite annual 
                        price increases, that business possesses pricing power.
                    </p>

                    <h3>The business must be swimming in cash</h3>
                    <p>
                        A business with the ability to generate a lot of cash from its operations/assets. 
                        Warren prefers companies with low CAPEX requirements and a conservative capital structure.
                    </p>

                    <h3>The business must have a great and shareholder-friendly management team</h3>
                    <p>
                        The management team must run the business as if they owned the entire enterprise.<br>
                        Capital allocation is the ‘science’ on how to best add shareholder value from the company’s profits. <br>
                        Basically, there are only two options: <br>
                        1) retain earnings in the company with the purpose of re-investing it back into the business, or <br>
                        2) return capital to shareholders through dividend or share buybacks. 
                    </p>

                    <h3>The business must be offerd at an attractive price</h3>
                    <p>
                        Even the most amazing business can be a bad investment if you pay too high a price for it. <br>
                        Keep in mind that “the price you pay determines your rate of return.<br>
                        Therefore, always be sure that you have a wide margin of safety between the purchase price and intrinsic value.
                    </p>

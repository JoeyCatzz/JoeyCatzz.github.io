                    <p>
                        To value a company we must look at the earnings model, the competitive advantage, Managment and the Financials.<br>
                    </p>
                    <div class="container pt-3 my-3">
                        <h3>The earnings model</h3>
                        <p>
                            How does the company makes money? Where does the company makes money?<br>
                            Stay in your circle of competence.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Competitive advantage</h3>
                        <p>
                            Does the company have a moat?<br>
                            <br>Low cost production:<br> 
                            Is it easy to start another company that does the excact same thing or is it to expesive? example: apple<br>
                            Can the company can produce cheaper product than the compition? example: basic-fit.<br>
                            <br>High Switching cost:<br>
                            Can a consumer easily swith to another company? example: busnisses running on windows<br>
                            <br>Network effects:<br>
                            The more customers the business has the better it gets. example: Waze<br>
                            <br>Intangible assets:<br>
                            Does the company have a strong brand: example Coca-Cola<br>
                            <br>Efficien Scale:<br>
                            Is the company scalable? example UPS<br>
                        </p>

                    <div class="container pt-3 my-3">
                        <h3>Managment</h3>
                        <p>
                            Who is managing the company? Managment must be focused on the long term strategy.<br>
                            CEO,CFO, COO. Do these people have integrity?<br> 
                            Is it a founder led company?<br>
                            Skin in the game? Do they own shares? As a rule of thump the CEO should own 5 times his year salary in shares.<br>
                        </p>

                        <h3>Financials</h3>
                        <p>
                            <h4>Is the company making any money?</h4>
                            <ol>
                                <li>A thing Rowan looks out for is the <a href="explanation_income_statement.html#ebita">EBITA</a>. Rowan is not a fan 
                                of a company using EBITA to talk about it's profit. He is more instrested in the 
                                <a href="explanation_income_statement.html#net_earnings">net earnings</a> of a company.<br></li>
                                <li>A second thing Rowan is intrested in is the <a href="explanation_cash_flow_statement.html#free_cash_flow">
                                Free Cash Flow</a>. Stay away if the free cash flow is negative. This means the company is not able to make money 
                                with its business.<br>
                                What should the company do with it's free cash flow?</li>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Acquisitions are in most cases not good.</li>
                                    <li>Paying back debt is a good idea.</li>
                                    <li>Dividents are something older companies do. (They don't grow anymore)</li>
                                    <li>Share buybacks are good. If the share price is lower than the intrinsic value.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </ol>

                                <li>Debt Position: <a href="explanation_ratios.html#debt_to_ebita">Debt to EBITA Ratio</a> must be smaller than 3.</li>
                                <li><a href="explanation_income_statement.html#net_earnings" >Net earnings</a> show great consistency (upward trend) over the last 10 years.</li>

                <p>
                    Even if the valuation of the company is good, there are also external factors that can influence our investment:<br>
                    competition, regulation, suppliers and customers.

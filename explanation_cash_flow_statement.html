                <h2 id="retained_earnings">Retained Earnings</h2>
                <p>
                    A company's net earnings can be paid out as dividends or used to buy back the company's shares, 
                    or it can be retained to keep the business growing.<br>
                    When they are retained in the business, they are added to an account on the balance sheet, under shareholders' equity 
                    called retained earnings.<br>
                    Retained earnings is an accumulated number, which means that each year's new retained earnings are added to the total 
                    of accumulated earnings from all prior years.<br>
                    If a company is not making additions to its retained earnings, it is not growing it's net earnings.
                </p>

            <h2 id="total_shareholders_equity">Total Shareholders Equity</h2>
                <p>
                    Shareholders' equity is equal to the company's total assets minus its total liabilities.<br>
                    That happens to equal the total sums of preferred and common stock, plus paid in capital, 
                    plus retained earnings, less treasury stock.<br>
                    Shareholders' equity has three sources. One is the capital that was originally raised selling preferred 
                    and common stock to the public.<br>
                    The second is any later sales of preferred and common stock to the public after the company is up and running.<br>
                    The third, and most important to us, is the accumulation of retained earnings.
                </p>

                    It is more intresting for the company to buy back shares.

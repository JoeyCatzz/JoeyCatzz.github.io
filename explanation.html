            <h2 id="revenue">Revenue</h2>
                <p>
                    The first line on the income statement is always total, or gross, revenue.<br>
                    The fact that a company has a lot of revenue doesn't mean that it is earning a profit.<br>
                    Total revenue minus expenses eaquals net earnings.
                </p>

            <h2 id="cost_of_goods_sold">Cost of Goods Sold</h2>
                <p>
                    Also known as Cost of Revenue.<br>
                    The cost of goods sold is either the cost of purchasing the goods a company is reselling or the cost 
                    of purchasing the materials and labor used in manufacturing the product it is selling.<br>
                    Cost of revenue is usually used if the company is in the business of providing services rather than products.
                </p>

        <h2 id="gross_profit">Gross Profit</h2>
            <p>
                Gross profit is how much money the company made off of total revenue after subtracting the costs of
                the raw goods and the labor used to make the goods.<br>
                It doesn't include such categories as sales and administrative costs, depreciation, 
                and the intersest cost of running the business.<br>                
            </p>

        <h2 id="net_earnings">Net Earnings</h2>
            <p>
                net earnings/net income/bottom line<br>
                Where we find out how much money the company has made after it paid income taxes.<br>
                Are the net earnings showing an historical upward trend? A single years entry for net earnings is useless.<br>
                The ride does not have to be smooth but there must be an upward historical trend.

            <h2 id="retained_earnings">Retained Earnings</h2>
            <p>
                A company's net earnings can be paid out as dividends or used to buy back the company's shares, 
                or it can be retained to keep the business growing.<br>
                When they are retained in the business, they are added to an account on the balance sheet, under shareholders' equity 
                called retained earnings.<br>
                Retained earnings is an accumulated number, which means that each year's new retained earnings are added to the total 
                of accumulated earnings from all prior years.<br>
                If a company is not making additions to its retained earnings, it is not growing it's net earnings.
            </p>
    
            <h2 id="total_shareholders_equity">Total Shareholders Equity</h2>
            <p>
                Shareholders' equity is equal to the company's total assets minus its total liabilities.<br>
                That happens to equal the total sums of preferred and common stock, plus paid in capital, 
                plus retained earnings, less treasury stock.<br>
                Shareholders' equity has three sources. One is the capital that was originally raised selling preferred 
                and common stock to the public.<br>
                The second is any later sales of preferred and common stock to the public after the company is up and running.<br>
                The third, and most important to us, is the accumulation of retained earnings.
            </p>
    
            <h2 id="long_term_debt">Long Term Debt</h2>
            <p>
                Long term debt means debt that matures any time out past a year. On the balance sheet it comes under the heading of 
                long term liablities.<br>

                   Money spend by a business on acquiring or maintaining fixed assets, such as land, buildings, and equipment.<br>
                   These are assets that are expensed over a period of time greater than a year through depreciation or amortiszation.

            <p>
                Issuance (Retirement) of Stock, Net = share buybacks<br>
                When a company payes dividends to the shareholder. The shareholder must pay income tax on the dividends.<br>
                It is more intresting for the company to buy back shares.

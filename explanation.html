                <h2 id="revenue">Revenue</h2>
                    <p>
                        The first line on the income statement is always total, or gross, revenue.<br>
                        The fact that a company has a lot of revenue doesn't mean that it is earning a profit.<br>
                        Total revenue minus expenses eaquals net earnings.
                    </p>

                <h2 id="cost_of_goods_sold">Cost of Goods Sold</h2>
                    <p>
                        Also known as Cost of Revenue.<br>
                        The cost of goods sold is either the cost of purchasing the goods a company is reselling or the cost 
                        of purchasing the materials and labor used in manufacturing the product it is selling.<br>
                        Cost of revenue is usually used if the company is in the business of providing services rather than products.
                    </p>

            <h2 id="gross_profit">Gross Profit</h2>
                <p>
                    Gross profit is how much money the company made off of total revenue after subtracting the costs of
                    the raw goods and the labor used to make the goods.<br>
                    It doesn't include such categories as sales and administrative costs, depreciation, 
                    and the intersest cost of running the business.<br>                
                </p>

            <h2 id="operating_expenses">Operating Expenses</h2>
                <p>
                    These are the company's hard costs associated with reseach and development of new products, <br>
                    selling and administrative costs of getting the products to market, <br>
                    depreciation and amortiszation, restructuring and impairment changes, <br>
                    and the catch-all "other" that includes all non-operating, non-recurring expenses.
                </p>

            <h2 id="selling_general_admin">Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses (SGA)</h2>
                <p>
                    This is where the company reports its costs for direct and indirect selling expenses and all general and 
                    administrative expenses.<br>
                    These include manafment salaries, advertising, travel costs, legal fees, commissions, all payroll costs, and the like.<br>
                    What happens is that sales start to fall, whick means revenues fall, but SGA costs remain. If the company can't cut SGA 
                    costs fast enough, they start eating into more and mare of the company's grass profit.<br>
                </p>

            <h2 id="reseach_and_development">Research and Development</h2>
                <p>
                    A lot off companies have a competitive advantage through a patent or some technological advantage.<br>
                    There is always the threat that a newer technology will replace it. These companies spend large sums of money in R&D.
                </p>

            <h2 id="depreciation">Depreciation</h2>
                <p>
                    All machinery and buildings evenyually wear out over time; this wearing out is recognized on the income statement as 
                    depreciation. Basically, the amount that something depreciates in a given year is a cost that is allocated against income 
                    for that year.<br>
                    An example: Imagine that a million-dollar printing press is bought by XYZ Printing Corporation. This printing press 
                    has a life span of ten years. Because it has a life span of ten years, the IRS will not let the company expense 
                    the entire $1 million cost in the year that it was purchased. Instead, the press must be expensed over the ten years 
                    that it is in service. This means that XYZ will depreciate the printing press at a rate of $100,000 a year.<br>
                    Depreciation is a real cost, because at some time in the future the printing press will have to be replaced.<br>
                    The buying of the printing press will on the balance sheet cause $1 million to come out of cash and $1 million to be 
                    added to plant and equipment.<br>
                    Then for the next ten years, the depreciated cost of $100,000 a year will show up on the income statement as an expense. 
                    On the balance sheet each year $100,000 will be subtracted from the plant and equipment assest account and $100,000 
                    added to the accumulated depreciation liabilities account.<br>
                    The actual $1 million cash out-lay for the printing press will show up on the cash flow statement under capital expenditures. 
                </p>

            <h2 id="operating_profit">Operating Profit</h2>
                <p>
                    Operating profit also known as Operating income<br>
                    or Earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) How ever EBIT includes revenue made from non-operating activities where as Operating Profit does not.<br>
                    <br>Operating profit = Gross Profit – Operating Expenses – Depreciation – Amortization<br>
                    Operating profit serves as a highly accurate indicator of a business’s health because it removes all expenses that 
                    are necessary to keep the business running from the calculation.
                </p>

            <h2 id="interest_expense">Interest Expense</h2>
                <p>
                    Interest Expense is the entry for the interest paid out, during the quarter of year, on the debt the company carries on its 
                    balance sheet as a liability. This is a financial cost, not an operating cost, and it is isolated out on its own, because 
                    it is not tied to any production or sales process. The more debt a company has the more interest it has to pay. <br>
                </p>

            <h2 id="sales_of_assets_other">Gain (or Loss) on Sales of Assets and Other</h2>
                <p>
                    When a company sells an asset (other than inventory), the profit or loss for the sale is recorded under Gain (or Loss) 
                    on Sales of Assets. <br>
                    An example: If the company had a building that it paid $1 million for, and after depreciating it down to $500,000, sold 
                    it for $800,000, the company would record a gain of $300,000 on the sale of the asset. Likewise, if the building 
                    sold for $400,000, the company would record a loss of $100,000.<br>
                    The same thing applies to the entry "Other". This is where non-operating, unusual, and infrequent income and expense 
                    events are netted out and entered onto the income statement. Such events would include the sale of fixed assets, 
                    such as property, plant, and equipment.<br>
                    Also under "Other" would be licensing agreements and the sale of patents, if they were categorized as outside the normal 
                    course of business.
                </p>

            <h2 id="income_before_tax">Income before Taxes</h2>
                <p>
                    Income before tax is a company's income after all expeneses have been deducted, but before income tax has been 
                    subtracted.
                </p>

            <h2 id="income_tax_paid">Income Tax Paid</h2>
                <p>
                    American corperations have to pay 35% of their income as taxes. One of the ways to see how much income a company is 
                    making is to see at the documents they file with the SEC and see what they are paying in income taxes.<br>
                    Take the number they list as pre-tax operating income and deduct 35% from it. If the remainder doesn't equal the 
                    amount the company reported as income taxes paid, something is wrong. 
                </p>

                <h2 id="net_earnings">Net Earnings</h2>
                <p>
                    net earnings/net income/bottom line<br>
                    Where we find out how much money the company has made after it paid income taxes.<br>
                    Are the net earnings showing an historical upward trend? A single years entry for net earnings is useless.<br>
                    The ride does not have to be smooth but there must be an upward historical trend.
                </p>
            
            <!--BALANCE SHEET-->
            <h2 id="assets">Assets & Cuttent Asser Cycle</h2>
                <p>
                    This is where all the goodies are kept: the cash, the plant and equipment, the patents, ...<br>
                    The balance sheet are divided in two groups: Current Assets, and All Other Assets. Current Assets can be or will be 
                    converted into cash in a very short period of time (usually within a year). As a rule, they are listed on the balance 
                    sheet in order of their liquidity.<br>
                    Current Assets are also known as quick, liquid, or floating assets.
                </p>

            <h3 id="working_assets">Current Asset Cycle</h3>
                <p>
                    Current assets are also referred to as the "working assets" of the business because they are in the cycle of cash going 
                    buy inventory; Inventory is then sold to vendors and becomes Accounts Receivable. Accounts Receivable, when collected 
                    from the vendors, they turn back into Cash. This cycle repeats itself over and over again, and it is how a business 
                    makes money. 
                </p>

            <h2 id="retained_earnings">Retained Earnings</h2>
                <p>
                    A company's net earnings can be paid out as dividends or used to buy back the company's shares, 
                    or it can be retained to keep the business growing.<br>
                    When they are retained in the business, they are added to an account on the balance sheet, under shareholders' equity 
                    called retained earnings.<br>
                    Retained earnings is an accumulated number, which means that each year's new retained earnings are added to the total 
                    of accumulated earnings from all prior years.<br>
                    If a company is not making additions to its retained earnings, it is not growing it's net earnings.
                </p>

            <h2 id="total_shareholders_equity">Total Shareholders Equity</h2>
                <p>
                    Shareholders' equity is equal to the company's total assets minus its total liabilities.<br>
                    That happens to equal the total sums of preferred and common stock, plus paid in capital, 
                    plus retained earnings, less treasury stock.<br>
                    Shareholders' equity has three sources. One is the capital that was originally raised selling preferred 
                    and common stock to the public.<br>
                    The second is any later sales of preferred and common stock to the public after the company is up and running.<br>
                    The third, and most important to us, is the accumulation of retained earnings.

                    Net Income/number of shares outstanding<br>
                    As an example: If a company had net earnings of $10 million for the year, and it has one million shares outstanding, 
                    it would have per-share earnings for the year of $10 a share.

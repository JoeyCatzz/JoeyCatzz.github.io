        <h2 id="retained_earnings">Retained Earnings</h2>
        <p>
            A company's net earnings can be paid out as dividends or used to buy back the company's shares, 
            or it can be retained to keep the business growing.<br>
            When they are retained in the business, they are added to an account on the balance sheet, under shareholders' equity 
            called retained earnings.<br>
            Retained earnings is an accumulated number, which means that each year's new retained earnings are added to the total 
            of accumulated earnings from all prior years.<br>
            If a company is not making additions to its retained earnings, it is not growing it's net earnings.
        </p>

        <h2 id="total_shareholders_equity">Total Shareholders Equity</h2>
        <p>
            Shareholders' equity is equal to the company's total assets minus its total liabilities.<br>
            That happens to equal the total sums of preferred and common stock, plus paid in capital, 
            plus retained earnings, less treasury stock.<br>
            Shareholders' equity has three sources. One is the capital that was originally raised selling preferred 
            and common stock to the public.<br>
            The second is any later sales of preferred and common stock to the public after the company is up and running.<br>
            The third, and most important to us, is the accumulation of retained earnings.
        </p>

        <h2 id="long_term_debt">Long Term Debt</h2>
        <p>
            Long term debt means debt that matures any time out past a year. On the balance sheet it comes under the heading of 
            long term liablities.<br>
        </p>

    <!--RATIO EXPLANATION-->
    <section>
        <h2 id="roe">ROE Return on Shareholders' Equity</h2>
        <p>
            Net Earnings divided by Shareholders' Equity equals Return on Shareholders' Equity.<br>
            High returns on equity mean that the company is making good use of the earnings that it is retaining.

                    <p>
                        The first line on the income statement is always total, or gross, revenue.<br>
                        The fact that a company has a lot of revenue doesn't mean that it is earning a profit.<br>
                        Total revenue minus expenses eaquals net earnings.

                        Also known as Cost of Revenue.<br>
                        The cost of goods sold is either the cost of purchasing the goods a company is reselling or the cost 
                        of purchasing the materials and labor used in manufacturing the product it is selling.<br>
                        Cost of revenue is usually used if the company is in the business of providing services rather than products.

                        Gross profit is how much money the company made off of total revenue after subtracting the costs of
                        the raw goods and the labor used to make the goods.<br>
                        It doesn't include such categories as sales and administrative costs, depreciation, 
                        and the intersest cost of running the business.<br>

                        These are the company's hard costs associated with reseach and development of new products, <br>
                        selling and administrative costs of getting the products to market, <br>
                        depreciation and amortiszation, restructuring and impairment changes, <br>
                        and the catch-all "other" that includes all non-operating, non-recurring expenses.

                        This is where the company reports its costs for direct and indirect selling expenses and all general and 
                        administrative expenses.<br>
                        These include manafment salaries, advertising, travel costs, legal fees, commissions, all payroll costs, and the like.<br>
                        What happens is that sales start to fall, whick means revenues fall, but SGA costs remain. If the company can't cut SGA 
                        costs fast enough, they start eating into more and mare of the company's grass profit.<br>

                    <p>
                        A lot off companies have a competitive advantage through a patent or some technological advantage.<br>
                        There is always the threat that a newer technology will replace it. These companies spend large sums of money in R&D.

                <h2 id="depreciation">Depreciation</h2>
                    <p>
                        All machinery and buildings evenyually wear out over time; this wearing out is recognized on the income statement as 
                        depreciation. Basically, the amount that something depreciates in a given year is a cost that is allocated against income 
                        for that year.<br>
                        An example: Imagine that a million-dollar printing press is bought by XYZ Printing Corporation. This printing press 
                        has a life span of ten years. Because it has a life span of ten years, the IRS will not let the company expense 
                        the entire $1 million cost in the year that it was purchased. Instead, the press must be expensed over the ten years 
                        that it is in service. This means that XYZ will depreciate the printing press at a rate of $100,000 a year.<br>
                        Depreciation is a real cost, because at some time in the future the printing press will have to be replaced.<br>
                        The buying of the printing press will on the balance sheet cause $1 million to come out of cash and $1 million to be 
                        added to plant and equipment.<br>
                        Then for the next ten years, the depreciated cost of $100,000 a year will show up on the income statement as an expense. 
                        On the balance sheet each year $100,000 will be subtracted from the plant and equipment assest account and $100,000 
                        added to the accumulated depreciation liabilities account.<br>
                        The actual $1 million cash out-lay for the printing press will show up on the cash flow statement under capital expenditures.

                <h2 id="operating_profit">Operating Profit</h2>
                    <p>
                        Operating profit also known as Operating income<br>
                        or Earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) How ever EBIT includes revenue made from non-operating activities where as Operating Profit does not.<br>
                        <br>Operating profit = Gross Profit – Operating Expenses – Depreciation – Amortization<br>
                        Operating profit serves as a highly accurate indicator of a business’s health because it removes all expenses that 
                        are necessary to keep the business running from the calculation.

                <h2 id="interest_expense">Interest Expense</h2>
                    <p>
                        Interest Expense is the entry for the interest paid out, during the quarter of year, on the debt the company carries on its 
                        balance sheet as a liability. This is a financial cost, not an operating cost, and it is isolated out on its own, because 
                        it is not tied to any production or sales process. The more debt a company has the more interest it has to pay. <br>
                    </p>

            <div class="container pt-3 my-3">
                <h2 id="sales_of_assets_other">Gain (or Loss) on Sales of Assets and Other</h2>
                    <p>
                        When a company sells an asset (other than inventory), the profit or loss for the sale is recorded under Gain (or Loss) 
                        on Sales of Assets. <br>
                        An example: If the company had a building that it paid $1 million for, and after depreciating it down to $500,000, sold 
                        it for $800,000, the company would record a gain of $300,000 on the sale of the asset. Likewise, if the building 
                        sold for $400,000, the company would record a loss of $100,000.<br>
                        The same thing applies to the entry "Other". This is where non-operating, unusual, and infrequent income and expense 
                        events are netted out and entered onto the income statement. Such events would include the sale of fixed assets, 
                        such as property, plant, and equipment.<br>
                        Also under "Other" would be licensing agreements and the sale of patents, if they were categorized as outside the normal 
                        course of business.

                <h2 id="income_before_tax">Income before Taxes</h2>
                    <p>
                        Income before tax is a company's income after all expeneses have been deducted, but before income tax has been 
                        subtracted.
                    </p>
            </div>

            <div class="container pt-3 my-3">
                <h2 id="income_tax_paid">Income Tax Paid</h2>
                    <p>
                        American corperations have to pay 35% of their income as taxes. One of the ways to see how much income a company is 
                        making is to see at the documents they file with the SEC and see what they are paying in income taxes.<br>
                        Take the number they list as pre-tax operating income and deduct 35% from it. If the remainder doesn't equal the 
                        amount the company reported as income taxes paid, something is wrong. 
                    </p>

                        net earnings/net income/bottom line<br>
                        Where we find out how much money the company has made after it paid income taxes.<br>
                        Are the net earnings showing an historical upward trend? A single years entry for net earnings is useless.<br>
                        The ride does not have to be smooth but there must be an upward historical trend.
